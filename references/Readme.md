# References used in the RNA004 Manuscript

This folder contains the reference files and basic annotations that were used in the associated publication of Hewel and Wierczeiko et al., 
In case of smaller reference genomes, the fasta file can already be found in this folder. In case of annotation bundles or larger reference genomes, 
we would like you to consult download.sh
